                <li>An <strong>issuer</strong>, usually a company, issues securities to be traded on the market (the
                    exchange).</li>
                <li>A <strong>regulatory</strong>, body will oversee the trading system to prevent fraud and
                    embezzlement.</li>
                <li>A <strong>facilitor</strong>, in this case the stock exchange, will ensure that the transaction
                    between the issuer and the investor is safe, fair, transparent and orderly.</li>
                <li>Finally, the <strong>inversor</strong>, which is usually a person or a company, invests in
                    securities on the market to make a profit in return, such as money or shares.</li>
